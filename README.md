— I got introduced to the rabbit hole of finance at the age of 11 because of the magic of the internet. after that, I've never looked back. started with reading the economic times and balance sheets of the companies in the last row of the class (so the teacher can't see me), in later years of school i got exposed to the concepts like sell-side markets, buy-side markets, capital markets, money markets, debt markets, venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, etc. so because of this curiosity, gradually i started to engage with some GPs at venture funds and hedge funds, fintech and DeFi founder on different stages. grateful to them because they also respected my curiosity.

— After finishing up my high school in the middle of the covid in monsoon-2021, i decided not to attend any university and go really deep into the stuff i am passionate about by being present in the markets themselves. after that it has been a crazy journey. learnt about venture capital, private equity and capital markets more deeply. learnt a lot from the fintech/defi founders, hedge fund and venture fund managers i engaged with. built stuff, built relationships, failed into stuff, spent long nights researching stuff. i gave myself the full privilege to take as many risks as i can possibly take and experiment a lot in my teens and twenties because most of the people i meet (successful/unsuccessful by societal norms) regret that they didn't take enough risks in their twenties, and i don't want to feel that about myself in my own thirties.

— Making lifetime friends along the way, not regretting any of my decisions. my aim is to detect as many problems as i can in capital markets in the next few years and then build robust solutions for them by founding cutting-edge products and capital pools.
